## Bugs, fixes, updates and changelog

This scraper is under active development. If you have any feature requests you can create an issue from [here](https://github.com/epctex/yelp-scraper/issues).

## Input Parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on Yelp that should be visited. Possible fields are:

- `search`: (Optional) (String) Keyword that you want to search on Yelp.

- `searchLocation`: (Optional) (String) Location that you want to initiate the search on Yelp.

- `startUrls`: (Optional) (Array) List of Yelp URLs. You should only provide business detail, event detail, event or business search, collections, collection detail or user detail URLs.

- `includeReviews`: (Optional) (Boolean) This will add all the reviews that Yelp provides into the detail objects. Please keep in mind that the time and resources the actor uses will increase proportionally by the number of reviews.

- `endPageForReviews`: (Optional) (Number) Final number of review page that you want to scrape. Default is `Infinite`. This is applies to user and business reviews individually.

- `endPage`: (Optional) (Number) Final number of page that you want to scrape. Default is `Infinite`. This is applies to all `search` request and `startUrls` individually.

- `maxItems`: (Optional) (Number) You can limit scraped items. This should be useful when you search through the big lists or search results.

- `proxy`: (Required) (Proxy Object) Proxy configuration.

- `extendOutputFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as argument and returns object with data.

- `customMapFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes each objects handle as argument and returns object with executing the function.

This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

### Tip

When you want to have a scrape over a specific list URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape as many items as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all the detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes with ~0.02-0.12 compute units.

### Yelp Scraper Input example

```json
{
  "startUrls":[
    "https://www.yelp.com/biz/maxs-restaurant-glendale-glendale-3",
    "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=a_UbCGv_MTAHFs3P_zxUDA",
    "https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=max&find_loc=Los+Angeles%2C+CA",
    "https://www.yelp.com/collection/qGqt9YpsLBCH5nruuVCK2A/Food",
    "https://www.yelp.com/collections/user?userid=a_UbCGv_MTAHFs3P_zxUDA",
    "https://www.yelp.com/events/la/browse?start_date=20230215",
    "https://www.yelp.com/events/monterey-park-monterey-park-strong-star-ballroom-shooting-community-resources"
  ],
  "search":"max",
  "searchLocation":"Los Angeles",
  "maxItems": 20,
  "includeReviews": true,
  "endPage":1,
  "endPageForReviews":1,
  "proxy":{
    "useApifyProxy":true
  }
}

```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Yelp Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Yelp actor.

			"review": "My wife and I were visiting the Santee Mall (or whatever they call it) and, after scoring a parking spot, we wandered into this little shopping mall to see what was in there. Around that time, I told my wife I needed to find a bathroom. This restaurant had one so I told her, &#34;Why don&#39;t we eat here for lunch?&#34; <br><br>I waited in line for the lavatory while my wife waited in line to order something. A lady who worked there approached me and I mentioned to her I was going to use the bathroom but my wife was in line. She seemed to tell me I couldn&#39;t use the bathroom. I pointed at my wife and said, &#34;We&#39;re ordering something.&#34; She walked away as if she didn&#39;t understand, so my wife told the lady (who was now behind the counter) we were ordering food so me using the bathroom was a non-issue. <br><br>Nonetheless, she chased my wife and I away, telling us we had to eat there in order to use the bathroom. Not only is that ridiculous, but we were planning on eating there anyway.....except we didn&#39;t, because we don&#39;t appreciate being treated like caca.<br><br>I have no idea what the food is like, but the customer service reeks. I really should have demanded to talk with the manager but I really needed to pee. What I did instead was I went down the hall to The Coffee Bean, where they not only treated me like a valued customer but also they gave me a token to use the public bathrooms down the hall.<br><br>I just find it disheartening that &#34;Bad Grill Express&#34; is not interested in my money or patronage.....I mean, I&#39;m pretty gringo so I hope it&#39;s not just Mexicans who are welcome."

The order was delivered within 20 minutes or so and for $8.75, the portions were pretty good. <br><br>I really liked the taste of the salad and the chips with salsa were good, but there was a strange charge...I forget the exact wording, but it said something along the lines of &#34;upcharge&#34; or &#34;rounding up&#34;. Ummm...what the fro, yo? <br><br>I definitely need to ask about that before ordering again...which I would like to do, because what you see on the menu is what you get. And THAT my friends is a beautiful thing in this age of false advertising.<br><br>Update 7/3 - Ordered the veggie omelet with a side of bacon and extra crispy hash browns. Man...what a great way to start the morning! Loaded with bell peppers and onions and melted cheese on top...very clean and very filling!! And my hashbrowns were ACTUALLY crispy! The only hiccup was that I asked for a side of bacon and they put it in my omelet instead...it actually made it better, so hoorayyyyy!! They knew what I wanted even when I didn&#39;t! <br><br>Great great food and decent prices!! I&#39;m definitely ordering breakfast from here more often!!"

The guy said either we pay the $30 or nothing I was trying to get more of an explanation and he hung up on me. <br>They have no right to be this rude when we are trying to give them business. They are scammers they tell you Â your order is ready right after you have ordered and they don&#39;t allow any changes to you order and will charge you more and take advantage of you if you substitute or change anything minor in your order!! <br>Do yourselves a favor and do not eat here their food is not that good and they are not afraid of being super rude and kicking you out. I hope this place loses all their business for this kind of behavior."
